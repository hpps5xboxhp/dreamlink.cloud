# DreamLink

DreamLink is a static website with tools running on the decentralized P2P network: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).

There is no need to install an IPFS node on your computer, DreamLink provides you with one that runs in your web browser. 

# âœ¨ Tools

All tools (except for search) run without central servers, on a network of thousands of nodes around the world, making it [fail-safe and censorship-proof](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/#decentralization).

- **Share.** Upload files and folders, without account, size or bandwith limits. You are your own file provider.
- **Search.** Search files and folders thanks to [ipfs-search.com](https://ipfs-search.com)
- **Pastebin.** Create and share any text format.
- **Chat.** Create an encrypted P2P chat room for free communication between people you trust.
